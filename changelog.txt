0.17.14:
 - set unique status codes for different types of message
  - translating wpkg-gp is now supported but i would advise to use ASCII characters only at the moment or you may run
    into string decoding problems with wpkg-gp client and the bootup execution display
 - added option to block all systems through the blacklist feature
  - Adding a line with !all! to the blacklist.txt wil block every connecting system
 - fixed network share connection problem if for some reason the share is allready connected to drive z
    - if the drive letter z create problem in some environments please let me know and i will make this configureable
      through the wpkg-gp config file.
