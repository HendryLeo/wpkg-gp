0.17.13:
 - now sets the wpkg running state to "true" in the registry (HLKM\SOFTWARE\WPKG\running) before wpkg is executed.
   wpkg will by default turn this false after it is done (if you have not disabled this in in the wpkg configuration)
   as failsafe wpkg-gp will set it to "false" when its service is started (reboot, manually restart of the service)
 - added "/dryrun" parameter to the query command so the wpkg.xml file date won't be altered.
